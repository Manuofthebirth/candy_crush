# Candy Crush

A vanilla JavaScript game inspired by Candy Crush based on [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania)'s [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XD5sZWxwJUk).

The main focus on this project was to improve on what was done in the [Tetris](https://github.com/Manuofthebirth/js-tetris) project (no Bootstrap aplied, createElement() function instead of lots of html divs for the grid construction, separate modules for the JS files..).

For now, it's only playable on a desktop [here](https://candy-crush-ff37.hostman.site/).

## What's different from the tutorial so far?

* checkRowForFive and checkColumnForFive functions
* Pause/Start button
* Countdown timer
* Moves counter
* JS file split into separate modules
* Styling

### Fixes

* Square id 63 ignored by checkRowFor/checkColumnFor functions

## JS inbuilt methods 

- add()
- addEventListener()
- appendChild()
- clearInterval()
- contains()
- continue
- createElement()
- every()
- forEach()
- getElementById()
- includes()
- push()
- remove()
- setAttribute()
- setInterval()
- some()

And more..
